# ML Hazard Detection

This repository provides all the essential tools and procedures required to prepare and merge the synthetic and CHV dataset into a format compatible with the YOLOv5 model for training purposes.

It serves as a proof of concept, demonstrating the potential of achieving excellent results by combining a small subset of real images with a larger synthetic dataset.

The subsequent steps are aimed at preparing the dataset for training an object detection algorithm, specifically designed to recognize and classify **person**, **vest**, and **helmet** categories.
