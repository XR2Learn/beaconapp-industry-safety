# Synthetic Dataset Generator

Synthetic Dataset Generator is a unity project that generates annotated RGB images for the purpose of training object detection algorithms. The scenario that gets examined by this application is the detection of hazards inside industrial environments through training machine learning components to recognize whether the appropriate safety equipment is worn.

Through the Unity game engine, 3D models of working employees equipped with different combinations of safety wearables are placed in various poses around the capturing frame. The resulting composition is being saved as a PNG accompanied by a JSON file containing annotations about the objects of the image. The dataset creation workflow will be broken down into different parts below in order to be better understood and utilized in scenarios other than hazard detection.
